This project aims to show how to monitor LLMs experiments. To run the LLM agent, we used LangChain and OpenAI libraries. By leveraging Comet's tools, we tracked this agent. 

To solve the hallucination, we first collect data with web scraping and then add this data to our LLM model. As a result, we obtained a language model that makes better predictions.
